	* lemonmenu.cpp (main_loop): fixed backward mapping of view change
	keys (use left-arrow to move left and right-arrow for right).
	(handle_run): moved game launching logic back into this method instead
	of using sdl threads.
	(launch_game): removed function.
	* lemonui.h (destroy_screen): new public method for destroying screen.
	* lemonui.cpp (~lemonui): moved screen and double buffer destruction
	to a new method.
	(destroy_screen): new method for destroying screen and double buffer.
	* lemonmenu.cpp (handle_run): removed win32 specific handling.

	* configure.in: setup BUILD_CC env var which looks for gcc and then
	cc.
	* Makefile.am: declare ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS so automatic autotool
	generation knows how to properly execute aclocal.
	* src/Makefile.am: build bin2c with BUILD_CC rather than CC.
	fix bug where if bin2c fails default_font.h would still be created and
	contain garbage.

	* lemonmenu.cpp (launch_game):
	Platform specific handing (windows, linux) of window when launching
	mame.


 Jan 03/2008
=======================

  flushing and special minimize/maximize handling on Linux
